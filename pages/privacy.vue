      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>9plus9 doing business as Dosable's Privacy Policy outlines the obligations of all users of the platform, including both vendors (contractors) and clients. This policy is a continuation of the Terms of Service, so it is important to read both documents together.</p>

      <h3>Information Collection</h3>
      <p>Dosable collects certain personally identifiable information about you, including information that is reasonably capable of being associated with you (“<b>Information</b>”).</p>
      <p>When registering an account on our Dosable Platform, it is mandatory to provide your Contact Information and Financial Information. As a user, this includes your first and last name, email address, phone number, birth date, and photo ID, which are necessary for the creation and management of your Dosable account. These details enable seamless communication between you and your Clients through our Platform.</p>
      <p><u>Personal Health Information</u>: By creating an account with Dosable, you are establishing a direct customer relationship to utilize the Service. Throughout your use of the Service, you may furnish information to Dosable, such as your name, email, social media profiles, date of birth, phone number, address, and transactional details. We categorize this information as not constituting "protected health information" or "medical information."</p>
      <p>You may also share certain health or medical information protected by applicable laws with Dosable. Dosable is not identified as a "covered entity" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, and its related regulations and amendments ("HIPAA"). The Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and/or Providers associated with the Service may or may not be "covered entities" or "business associates" under HIPAA. However, in specific cases, Dosable might be deemed a "business associate" of a Pharmacy or Medical Group.</p>
      <p>HIPAA may not be applicable solely based on the involvement of health information, and it might not govern transactions and/or communications with Dosable, the Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and/or Providers of the Service. In instances where Dosable is regarded as a "business associate," it could be subject to specific HIPAA provisions regarding protected Health Information ("PHI") that you share with Dosable, the Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and/or Providers. Moreover, any medical and/or health information subject to protections under applicable state laws will be handled in compliance with those laws (collectively, "Protected Information"). However, information not qualifying as Protected Information under applicable laws may be utilized or disclosed as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>The Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and/or Providers each maintain their own Privacy Policy notices outlining how they handle and disclose Protected Information. By using the Service, you acknowledge receipt and confirm that you have read, accepted, and adhere to the Privacy Policies of the Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and/or Providers, available on their respective websites.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, by accessing or using the Service, you recognize that if HIPAA applies to Dosable, the Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and/or Providers, any information submitted to Dosable, not intended solely for the provision of diagnosis and treatment, is not considered Protected Information. Such information will be subject only to our Privacy Policy and any applicable state laws governing the privacy and security of such information. To clarify, the information provided to Dosable for account creation, including your name, email, social media profiles, date of birth, phone number, address, and transactional details, is not deemed Protected Information.</p>
