      <h1>Safety Information</h1>
      <p><b>Fungaid Custom Rx Topical:</b></p>
      <p><b>Read this safety information before starting this medication and with every refill. There may be new information. This information is not a substitute for discussing your medical condition or treatment with your healthcare provider.</b></p>
      <p><b>This compounded product has not been approved by the FDA. It is only available if prescribed by a dermatologist through Dosable.com who will determine if treatment is suitable. </b></p>
      <h3>What I need to know about topical Fungaid Rx Compound:</h3>
      <p>Fungaid is a compounded topical medication combining itraconazole, fluconazole, terbinafine, ibuprofen, and tea tree oil, compounded together as an off-label topical therapy aiding in promoting a healthy nail matrix, elimination of fungal spores and membranes and preventing further pathological thickening of the nail bed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Itraconazole</b> is an antifungal medication commonly used to treat nail fungus infections, a condition known as onychomycosis. It belongs to a class of drugs called triazole antifungals. Itraconazole works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cells. By inhibiting squalene epoxidase, terbinafine disrupts the synthesis of ergosterol. Without sufficient ergosterol, fungal cell membranes become structurally unstable and more permeable. Additionally, the accumulation of toxic squalene and other intermediates within the fungal cells further disrupts the integrity and function of the cell membrane. </li>
        <li><b>Fluconazole</b> interferes with the activity of certain enzymes known as cytochrome P450 enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. These enzymes are part of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, similar to the way they are targeted by other azole antifungal medications. </li>
        <li><b>Terbinafine</b> targets an enzyme called squalene epoxidase, which is a key enzyme in the fungal ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. Ergosterol is a vital component of fungal cell membranes, similar to cholesterol in human cell membranes.</li>
        <li><b>Ibuprofen</b> acts on isolated dermatophytes may related to the inhibitory action of on-secreted COX that is produced by fungal cells and not to direct toxicity that NSAIDs may have. Inhibition of prostaglandin production is not the only mechanism of ibuprofen in fungal cells.</li>
        <li><b>Tea tree oil</b> contains compounds called terpenes, with terpinen-4-ol being the most well-known and active component. Terpinen-4-ol is believed to have antifungal activity by disrupting the structure and function of fungal cell membranes. It may interfere with fungal enzymes and proteins, leading to the inhibition of fungal growth and proliferation.</li>
      </ul>
