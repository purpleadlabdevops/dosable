      <h3>Ambit of Service</h3>
      <p>Dosable operates as a technological platform connecting registered users of the Website with Physicians, pharmacies, and other healthcare providers for medical consultations and the dispensing of prescribed medications. It is important to clarify that Dosable is not a healthcare provider or pharmacy, and it does not offer or provide medical advice, treatment recommendations, or pharmacy services. By using the platform, you acknowledge that you are not establishing a physician-patient relationship with Dosable. Dosable is not responsible for any advice, medical care, or treatment provided by affiliated Physicians, pharmacies ("Pharmacies"), or other healthcare providers. Additionally, Dosable disclaims liability for any consequences, injuries, or harm resulting from such interactions.</p>
      <p>Dosable does not own the Medical Practice, nor does it control the practice of medicine by the Medical Practice or its Physicians. The content on the Website and Services, including text, audio, video, photographs, illustrations, graphics, and visuals, is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or recommendations from Dosable.</p>
      <p>Dosable offers products and services to registered Service users ("Users"), including those provided by Dosable itself or third-party medical providers, pharmacies, and vendors affiliated with the Company's Service. The Service provides access to prescription fulfillment services from specific pharmacies, such as EHT Pharmacy LLC doing business as Curexa and Madame Rx LLC doing business as Chemistry Rx (referred to as the "Pharmacies"). Additionally, users may have access to medical groups on the Platform (referred to as the "Medical Groups"), such as Beluga Health . These Medical Groups employ or contract with healthcare professionals, also known as "Providers" or "Health Counselors," who offer various healthcare services through the Platform. By accepting the Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that any services received from the Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and/or Providers through the Platform are governed by this Agreement, with the Pharmacies, Medical Groups, and Providers recognized as third-party beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>While you do not form a doctor-patient or any other health care provider-patient relationship with Dosable, your use of the Service establishes a direct customer relationship with Dosable. This includes engaging in the purchase of prescription and/or non-prescription products, as well as non-medical services directly offered to you by Dosable through the Service. As part of this customer relationship, you may provide the Company with personal information, including health information, either directly or on your behalf. The usage of such information by the Company is governed by its Privacy Policy, which can be found in the "Privacy Policy" section on the Company's Website.</p>
      <h3>Account Creation</h3>
      <p>Upon completing your registration, you can utilize the website to seek consultation for prescription filling at a different pharmacy. We will forward the prescription to your chosen physician and, if deemed medically necessary, process your order for products. Some items on the website may require a prescription, while others do not. A licensed physician from the relevant medical practice in your state will be assigned to review your registration, provide a diagnosis, assess the medical appropriateness of your desired products, and, if suitable, issue a prescription. However, the issuance of any prescription is not guaranteed. You have the option to request a different physician. Your product order will only be accepted after a physician conducts a medical consultation, evaluates the clinical appropriateness of the requested item, and issues a prescription if required. DEA controlled substances will not be prescribed. If your physician decides not to issue a required prescription after a medical consultation,. If you opt for a different pharmacy, you are responsible for picking up and paying for the prescription. Some products on the website may not necessitate a prescription, allowing you to purchase them post-registration without a medical consultation. Prescriptions filled by the pharmacy will be shipped to you, with associated shipping costs.. Pharmaceutical product returns cannot be accepted. Dosable does not endorse specific medications, pharmacies, or physicians.</p>
      <h3>Health Counseling</h3>
      <p>Users acknowledge and accept that Dosable bears no responsibility for the information conveyed by any Health Counselors. Dosable does not offer any medical services. In addition to other functions, Dosable furnishes a technological platform to facilitate coordination and communication with healthcare providers. It is understood that engaging in coordination and/or consultation with a healthcare provider via the Dosable platform does not establish a provider-patient relationship with Dosable or its Health Counselors, as defined by US federal and state laws.</p>
      <p>Whenever Dosable employs terms such as "your physician," "your medical practitioner," "your doctor," "healthcare provider," or similar expressions, including in this Agreement, the Company is specifically addressing your primary care physician. This refers to the healthcare professional with whom you have a mutually recognized doctor-patient relationship within the state of your residence. It's important to note that Health Counselors on the Dosable platform are not considered "your" doctor, physician, medical practitioner, healthcare provider, or dermatologist. Consultations with the doctors affiliated with the Company do not serve as a substitute for your existing relationship with any physician.</p>
      <p>Telemedicine Provider License Disclosure</p>
      <p>It is important to note that in compliance with the telehealth laws of specific states, we are required to publicly disclose licensure and identifying information about our provider, Jonah Mink, MD, from Beluga Health, whose National Provider Identifier (NPI) is 1083052351.

      <p>Specific additional terms are applicable to Physicians using the Dosable platform. In case of any conflict between the supplemental terms outlined in this Section 13 and other terms herein, these additional terms shall take precedence.</p>
      <p>To qualify as a Physician using the website, you must be a licensed physician under contract with or employed by the Medical Practice. Additionally, you are required to agree to adhere to all relevant medical and professional board laws, rules, regulations, and other guidance applicable to you as a Physician in the state(s) where you offer your services. Your relationship with Dosable users, including Dosable patients, is a direct arrangement between you and these individuals. Dosable users do not establish a provider-patient relationship with Dosable. Dosable does not engage in medical practice or provide any medical services. As elaborated below, Physicians are solely responsible for all agreements, consents, notices, and interactions with patients and other consumers. Dosable bears no liability to Physicians for any amounts owed by patients or other consumers.</p>
      <p>Dosable does not offer medical advice, legal advice, or representations concerning any legal or medical issues related to Physicians, their goods, or services. This includes compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with state or federal laws and regulations.</p>
      <p>Physicians must use the website and provide services in accordance with applicable standards of good medical and professional practice. While software products like the website can enhance the quality of services offered to patients, various factors, including the provider-patient relationship, can impact patient outcomes. Due to intricate technologies and complex decision-making, accurately determining influencing factors and their proportions in an outcome can be challenging or impossible. Physicians are solely responsible for their use of the website and the provision of services.</p>
      <p>Due to complexities and uncertainties in the patient care process, Physicians agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Dosable harmless from any claim brought against Dosable by or on behalf of a patient, a third party, or someone claiming damage due to a familial or financial relationship with a patient. This indemnification applies regardless of the cause, arising from the Physician's use or operation of the website and services. Physicians must obtain Dosable's prior written consent for any settlement or judgment where they acknowledge fault in Dosable or defects in the website or services. Dosable will promptly notify Physicians in writing of any claim subject to this indemnification, provide them with necessary information for defense, and grant exclusive control over defense and settlement.</p>
      <p>As a Physician using the services, you expressly represent that: (i) you are fully licensed and qualified to provide the requested services; (ii) your provision of advice or services complies with all applicable federal and state laws, including patient privacy laws like HIPAA; (iii) you bear full responsibility for the consequences of any advice or information provided through the services; and (iv) your provision of advice or information adheres to professional standards and best practices in your industry.</p>
